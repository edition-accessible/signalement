          Reading a publication is a deeply personal experience. We all have our
          routines-a trip to the bookstore, a search for our favorite title, or
          a casual browse through the best-seller list. Then, we purchase and
          dive into the publication. It&#x27;s a simple, yet profound act.

          Consider being visually impaired and relying on assistive technology
          to read a publication. You may wonder: Will my screen reader be
          compatible with this title? Are there image descriptions available for
          the visuals? Are there accessible page numbers? Is the reading order
          correct to avoid potential hazards? These are just a few of the
          accessibility concerns for consumers when buying and reading a digital
          publication.

          For years, because ebooks are not available in the standard
          distribution chain (bookstores or libraries) and because information
          about accessibility features of ebooks is not available, readers with
          specific needs have relied on Library Service to Persons with
          Disabilities, which provides adaptations of books in specialised
          formats, with all known limitations.

          But the landscape is changing. More and more publishers are now
          creating publications that are Born Accessible. These are not just
          accessible from the outset, but also come with detailed information
          about their accessibility features. It&#x27;s a promising shift in the
          industry.

          However, the success of these efforts hinges on one crucial factor:
          the end users. Without their understanding and engagement, all our
          work would be in vain. They are not just readers, but an integral part
          of the ecosystem. It’s imperative to involve them in our projects and
          ensure we serve them as best as possible.

          Before anything, we have to think about what constitutes an accessible
          ebook. We, experts, often say that an ebook is WCAG AA compliant, but
          WCAG is not accessibility; it is only a means of assessing it. I
          invite you to take a user-centric approach and always get back to the
          core question: How do people read?

          In that approach, an accessible book is not the same for everyone, and
          we can need different ways to read depending on the time of the day,
          our cognitive load and many other factors.

            Some people rely on visual reading but need to adjust text display
            and modify layout. This means we need to be able to change fonts,
            sizes, spaces, margins, justification, color, etc., and as many
            personalisation options as possible to help us access reading
            visually.

          An accessible book is one that meets readers&#x27; needs, and not all
          readers have the exact same needs. Therefore, accessibility is not a
          binary yes or no. Users need as much information as possible to decide
          if a book is accessible to them.

          It’s a paradigm shift from a format-based approach: accessible ebooks
          such as Word, DAISY, and EPUB to a Feature-based perspective: ebooks
          allow Visual Adjustments, visual Reading, and rich Navigation…

          The format approach does not say if images are described in text or if
          print pagination is available. PDFs are known to be poorly accessible,
          but they can still be readable by screen readers if they have been
          produced properly. On the other hand, most daisy audio-only volunteer
          records have very partial accessibility features outside of being
          human narrated, precisely because of the time-consuming
          non-professional production.

          The challenge now is to know what features an ebook includes,
          independently of the format. This applies to trade ebooks as well as
          to specialised libraries or NGO productions.

          With that reader-first approach, we don’t know how many ebooks are
          accessible. The blocker here is the format-defined collection
          approach. We know there are 1 million titles available in ABC global
          book service, 180 thousand titles are available in braille and audio
          in the NLS catalogue, and 73 thousand Daisy audio are available in the
          French Association Valentin Hauy specialised collections.

        <p id="16f86caf-3fc2-4efb-9ce3-7226b1131b72" class="">
          Those of us who produce and manage those collections know that they
          are largely human-narrated books with no text synchronisation, few
          navigation options, and fewer advanced features.

          the US.

          Only 3% of ebooks have any accessibility information available in ONIX
          (so for retailer use), while close to 10% had this information
          available in the file. A simple file analysis proved that 93% of them
          had at least one accessibility feature.

          That could be a non relevant information, so let’s be more precise.
          From the same work, looking at publications entirely textual (so
          readable with a screen reader), no information available in ONIX, 5%
          of titles with that information in the file and 15% inferred from
          simple automated analysis. That’s 300 thousand titles that are
          readable today for a blind person. We just don’t know it. That’s a
          very minimum, there’s probably more than double if we succeed in

          It started in 2020 with a landscape analysis, then a set of prototypes
          based on the first W3C recommendation. Those prototypes where
          submitted to 54 persons from 30 organisations including associations
          representing readers with special needs. Two questions where asked: is
          the user experience understandable and is it doable? Responses were
          almost negative, so we took action to enhance the availability of
          metadata, and the expressable options in different metadata standards
          and built new prototypes to iterate on other workshops. For the
          wording, we built a localized vocabulary study including different
          users to take part in to open survey as well as controlled panels.
          Once we had reached a satisfactory point, we moved on from the
          prototypes to the validation of the concepts by the bookseller portal
          suppliers. They carried out individual usability tests and gathered
          extensive feedback.

          It’s a paradigm shift from a format-based approach: accessible ebooks
          such as Word, DAISY, and EPUB to a Feature-based perspective: ebooks
          allow Visual Adjustments, non-visual Reading, and rich Navigation…

          The format approach does not say if images are described in text or if
          print pagination is available. PDFs are known to be poorly accessible,
          but they can still be readable by screen readers if they have been
          produced correctly. On the other hand, most daisy audio-only volunteer
          records have partial accessibility features outside of being human
          narrated precisely because of the time-consuming non-professional
          production.

          With that reader-first approach, we don’t know how many ebooks are

          It started in 2020 with a landscape analysis, then a set of prototypes
          based on the first W3C recommendation. Those prototypes were submitted
          to 54 persons from 30 organisations, including associations
          representing readers with special needs. Two questions were asked: is
          the user experience understandable and is it doable? Responses were
          almost negative, so we took action to enhance the availability of
          metadata and the expressable options in different metadata standards.
          We then built new prototypes to iterate on other workshops. For the
          wording, we built a localised vocabulary study including different
          users to participate in an open survey and controlled panels. Once we
          had reached a satisfactory point, we moved on from the prototypes to
          proof of concept by the bookseller portal suppliers. They carried out
